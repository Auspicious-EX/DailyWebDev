# Tutorial **6** Notes


In this tutorial, we'll explore the basics of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and dive into Core Web Vitals, which are essential for improving user experience and search engine rankings.

## What is SEO?

SEO refers to the process of optimizing a website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). It involves various strategies and techniques to improve visibility and drive organic (unpaid) traffic to a website.

## What Do Search Engines Prefer to Show First on User Screens?

Search engines prioritize showing relevant and high-quality content that best matches a user's query. Factors such as relevance, authority, and user experience influence search engine rankings.

## What are Core Web Vitals?

Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers crucial for a good user experience. They include:

- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Measures the visual stability of a webpage.
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Measures loading performance by identifying the largest element visible within the viewport.
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Measures interactivity by quantifying the responsiveness of a webpage when a user interacts with it.

Improving Core Web Vitals can lead to better user engagement and higher search engine rankings.

### Lighthouse in Browser

Lighthouse is an open-source tool integrated into web browsers like Google Chrome. It helps developers improve the quality of web pages by auditing performance, accessibility, SEO, and more.

## Meta Tags and Title Tags for SEO

Meta tags, including meta description, meta keywords, and title tags, play a crucial role in SEO by providing information about the content of web pages to search engines.

- **Meta Description**: Provides a brief summary of the page content.
- **Meta Keywords**: Specifies relevant keywords related to the page content (less important for SEO in modern search engine algorithms).
- **Title Tag**: Defines the title of the web page displayed in search engine results.
