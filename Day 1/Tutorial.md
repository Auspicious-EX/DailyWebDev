# Tutorial **1** Notes

**Client**: The client is typically a device such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet that requests information or resources from a server. Clients can be web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari), mobile apps, or any software that accesses web content.

**Server**: A server is a computer or system that hosts and provides resources, services, or data to clients over a network. When a client requests something, like a web page, the server processes the request and sends the necessary information back to the client.

**Browser**: A web browser is software that enables users to access and view websites on the internet. Browsers interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to render web pages visually. When you type a web address into your browser or click on a link, the browser sends a request to the server hosting that website. Once the server receives the request, it processes it and sends back the requested web page, which the browser then displays to the user.

**Example:**

Imagine you're sitting at home (the client) and you want to order a pizza (a web page) from your favorite pizza place (the server). Here's how it works:

- You (the client): You're hungry and you want pizza, so you pick up the phone (or use an app) to call the pizza place.

- Pizza Place (the server): The pizza place has all the pizzas ready to go. When they get your call, they listen to what you want (your order).

- Order Request: You tell the pizza place what you want: maybe a large pepperoni pizza with extra cheese. This is like your request for a specific web page when you type a web address into your browser.

- Pizza Making (Server Processing): The pizza place takes your order, makes your pizza, and gets it ready to deliver to you. Similarly, the server processes your request, finds the right web page, and gets it ready to send back to your browser.

- Delivery (Response): Once your pizza is ready, the pizza delivery person brings it to your house. In the same way, the server sends the web page back to your browser.

- Enjoy Your Pizza (Displaying the Web Page): Finally, you receive your pizza and enjoy eating it. Similarly, your browser receives the web page and displays it on your screen so you can see and interact with it.
