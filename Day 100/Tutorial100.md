# Tutorial **100** Notes

## Handling Forms in React

Handling forms in React is a crucial aspect of creating interactive applications. React makes form handling straightforward by providing controlled components, where form data is managed by the React component's state.

#### **1. Controlled Components**
Controlled components are form elements where the value of the element is controlled by React. The state of the input field is maintained in the React component, and the value of the form input is updated based on that state.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyForm() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setInputValue(e.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Form submitted with:', inputValue);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={inputValue} 
        onChange={handleChange} 
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
In this example, the input field is a controlled component, with its value tied to the `inputValue` state. The `handleChange` function updates the state on each keystroke, and `handleSubmit` handles form submission.

#### **2. Handling Multiple Inputs**
For forms with multiple fields, you can manage the state of each input by using an object in the state.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyForm() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    email: ''
  });

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData({
      ...formData,
      [name]: value
    });
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Form data submitted:', formData);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        name="name" 
        value={formData.name} 
        onChange={handleChange} 
        placeholder="Name"
      />
      <input 
        type="email" 
        name="email" 
        value={formData.email} 
        onChange={handleChange} 
        placeholder="Email"
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
In this example, each input's value is tied to a different property in the `formData` object, and `handleChange` updates the corresponding field.

#### **3. Validation**
You can easily integrate validation into the form by adding conditions before submission.

**Example:**
```jsx
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (!formData.name || !formData.email) {
    alert('Please fill out all fields');
    return;
  }
  console.log('Form data submitted:', formData);
};
```
This simple validation checks that all fields are filled before submitting the form.

### Connecting React to an Express Backend

To create a full-stack application, React can be connected to an Express backend. The React frontend can communicate with the backend via HTTP requests.

#### **1. Setting Up the Express Backend**
First, you need to set up a basic Express server that can handle API requests.

**Example: Express Server Setup**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/form', (req, res) => {
  const formData = req.body;
  console.log('Form data received:', formData);
  res.status(200).send('Form data received');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```
This Express server listens for POST requests at `/api/form` and logs the form data.

#### **2. Fetching Data from React**
You can use `fetch` or `axios` in your React component to send data to the Express server.

**Example: Connecting to Express with Fetch**
```jsx
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (!formData.name || !formData.email) {
    alert('Please fill out all fields');
    return;
  }

  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/form', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('Form data sent successfully');
    } else {
      console.error('Failed to send form data');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
};
```
In this example, the form data is sent to the `/api/form` endpoint using a POST request.

#### **3. Deploying Full-Stack Application**
To deploy a React and Express application:
- **Build the React App**: Run `npm run build` in your React project to create a production build.
- **Serve React with Express**: Serve the built React files using Express by adding the following code to your Express server:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

// Serve static files from the React app
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client/build')));

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'client/build', 'index.html'));
});
```
- **Deploy to a Hosting Platform**: Deploy the combined application to platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or a VPS.

### **Summary**
Handling forms in React involves managing form state using controlled components and handling validation. Connecting React to an Express backend allows for full-stack development, where the frontend communicates with the backend using HTTP requests. This approach provides a seamless way to handle form submissions and data processing in modern web applications.
