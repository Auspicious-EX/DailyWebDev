# Tutorial **11** Notes

In this tutorial, we'll discuss semantic tags in HTML, their importance, and the benefits they offer.

## What are Semantic Tags in HTML?

Semantic tags in HTML are elements that carry meaning and convey the structure of the content they wrap. They provide context to the content, making it more understandable for both humans and machines.

## Why Do We Use Semantic Tags?

Semantic tags are used to improve the structure, accessibility, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of web pages. They help browsers, search engines, screen readers, and other assistive technologies understand the content and its significance.

## Semantic vs. Non-Semantic Tags

Semantic tags describe their content, while non-semantic tags are generic and do not provide any context. Semantic tags are meaningful and have specific purposes, while non-semantic tags are often used for styling or layout purposes.

### Examples of Semantic Tags:
- `<header>`: Used to define introductory content at the beginning of a section or page, often containing logos, navigation menus, or headings.

- `<nav>`: Used to define a navigation menu, typically containing links to other pages or sections within the website.

- `<main>`: Used to define the main content area of a webpage, excluding any header, footer, or sidebar content.

- `<section>`: Used to group related content together within a webpage, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other thematic grouping.

- `<article>`: Used to define a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.

- `<aside>`: Used to define content that is related to the main content but can be considered separate from it, such as sidebars, pull quotes, or advertisements.

- `<footer>`: Used to define a footer for a section or webpage, often containing copyright information, contact details, or links to related pages.


### Examples of Non-Semantic Tags:
- `<div>`
- `<span>`
- `<div>`

2. **Better SEO**: Search engines can better understand the structure and relevance of the content, leading to improved search engine rankings.
3. **Clearer Code**: Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable and maintainable by providing a clear structure and hierarchy.
4. **Future-Proofing**: Semantic tags make it easier to update and maintain web pages, as they provide a standardized way to define the structure of content.

## Conclusion

Semantic tags play a crucial role in HTML by providing meaning and structure to web content. By using semantic tags effectively, you can improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of your web pages.
