# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

## Key Features of CSS
- **Selectors**: These are used to select the HTML elements you want to style.
- **Properties and Values**: Each style rule consists of a property and a value. For example, `color: red;` sets the text color to red.
- **Box Model**: This includes margins, borders, padding, and the content area to define the space around and inside an element.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS allows the creation of responsive web pages that adjust to different screen sizes.

## Basic Syntax
CSS is composed of style rules that the browser interprets and then applies to the corresponding elements in your document. Here is an example:

```css
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
    color: navy;
    margin-left: 20px;
}
```

## Benefits of CSS
- Separation of Content and Presentation: Keeps HTML clean and focuses on structure while CSS handles the design.
- Reusability: CSS rules can be reused across multiple pages, reducing repetition and effort.
- Accessibility: Proper use of CSS improves accessibility for different devices and users.
