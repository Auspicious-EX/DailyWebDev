# Tutorial 16
Sure! Let's start by cleaning up the code and addressing selectors and Masterclass.

**Definition:**

**Selectors**: In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. They can be simple, like element selectors (`p` for paragraphs), or more complex, like class selectors (`.classname`), ID selectors (`#idname`), attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements.

**Masterclass**: Generally, a masterclass refers to a class taught by an expert, often in a particular field such as cooking, music, or technology. In web development, it could mean a comprehensive course or tutorial given by a seasoned professional on a particular topic like CSS, JavaScript, or design principles.

Here's the cleaned-up code incorporating these concepts:

```python
import os

# Get the current directory where the script is located
base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Loop through Day 21 to Day 100
for day in range(21, 101):
    # Construct the folder name
    day_folder = f'Day {day}'
    # Construct the path to the day folder
    day_folder_path = os.path.join(base_dir, day_folder)
    # Construct the path to the 'image' folder inside the day folder
    image_folder_path = os.path.join(day_folder_path, 'image')
    
    # Create the 'image' folder if it doesn't exist
    os.makedirs(image_folder_path, exist_ok=True)

print("Image folders created successfully.")
```

### Explanation:
- **Selectors in CSS**:
  - **Element Selector**: `p { color: blue; }` (applies to all `<p>` elements).
  - **Class Selector**: `.classname { color: blue; }` (applies to elements with `class="classname"`).
  - **ID Selector**: `#idname { color: blue; }` (applies to the element with `id="idname"`).
  - **Attribute Selector**: `[type="text"] { color: blue; }` (applies to elements with `type="text"`).
  - **Pseudo-class Selector**: `a:hover { color: blue; }` (applies when mouse hovers over a `<a>` element).
    Sure! Here are more types of CSS selectors:

### 1. **Universal Selector**
- **Syntax**: `*`
- **Description**: Selects all elements on the page.
- **Example**:
  ```css
  * {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
  }
  ```

### 2. **Group Selector**
- **Syntax**: `selector1, selector2`
- **Description**: Applies the same styles to multiple selectors.
- **Example**:
  ```css
  h1, h2, h3 {
      color: blue;
  }
  ```

### 3. **Descendant Selector**
- **Syntax**: `ancestor descendant`
- **Description**: Selects elements that are inside another element.
- **Example**:
  ```css
  div p {
      color: red;
  }
  ```

### 4. **Child Selector**
- **Syntax**: `parent > child`
- **Description**: Selects direct child elements of a specified parent.
- **Example**:
  ```css
  ul
- **Masterclass**:
  - A masterclass in CSS might cover advanced topics like grid layout, flexbox, animations, and responsive design, providing in-depth knowledge from an expert in the field.

By restructuring the Python code and explaining CSS selectors and the concept of a masterclass, it should now be clear and well-organized.
